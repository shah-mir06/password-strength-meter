# Password Strength Meter  

## Introduction  

The **Password Strength Meter** is a simple yet effective tool built with Python and Streamlit. It allows users to check the strength of their passwords by analyzing length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand **string manipulation, user input handling, and conditional logic** in Python.

## Features  

**Checks Password Strength** – Evaluates passwords based on key security factors.  
**Interactive UI** – Built with Streamlit for a simple and user-friendly experience.

## How It Works  

The tool assigns a **score (0-3)** based on password security measures:  

**Length (8+ characters)**  
**Contains Uppercase Letters**  
**Includes Numbers**  
**Has Special Characters (!@#$%^&*)**  

Based on the score, the password is classified as:  

- **Very Weak** (0)  
- **Weak** (1)  
- **Moderate** (2)  
- **Strong** (3)

**See the strength rating**:  
   - **Very Weak** – Lacks basic security requirements.  
   - **Weak** – Needs improvement, missing key elements.  
   - **Moderate** – Decent, but could be stronger.  
   - **Strong** – Secure and recommended.
